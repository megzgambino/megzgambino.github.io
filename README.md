Final Project of Phase0-Hacktiv8


So this simple project starts with my passion in Basketball, especially with Jimmy Butler. He's one of my favorite player that's playing on court for now.

Since he moved to Miami, he finally reached his peak performance and finally got a better teammates such as Goran Dragic, Bam Adebayo and Duncan Robinson.

In this project, I simply combine the concept of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The logic behind the javascript is really simple, using a math.floor and math.random in displaying the player name and also the photos on the website.
