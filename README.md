Final Project of Phase0-Hacktiv8


So this simple project starts with my passion in Basketball, especially with Jimmy Butler. He's one of my favorite player that's playing on court for now.

Jimmy Butler is a type of player that wakes up around 3am in the morning and starts training, a type of player that is a living example motto of "Hard Work Beats Talent, When Talent Doesn't Work Hard", he is that eager to become the best at what he does.

Since he moved to Miami, he finally reached his peak performance, fit into the "Heat Culture" and  finally got a better teammates such as Goran Dragic, Bam Adebayo and Tyler Herro that's willing to wakes up around 3am in the morning and starts grinding at the training court.

Enough with the background.

In this project, I simply combine the concept of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The logic behind the javascript is really simple, using a math.floor and math.random in displaying the player name and also the photos on the website.

I invoked the function inside the onclick in html to make sure the logic will start only after the button got pressed.

Really simple.
